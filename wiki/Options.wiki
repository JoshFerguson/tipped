#summary Options available for Tipped

By default, Tipped creates a hover triggered tip, pulling the value from the _title_ attribute. Changing these options will alter that behaviour.


= Options =
*ajaxType*
 The type of HTTP request to make.

 _Possible values_: "POST", "GET"

 _Default_: "POST"

*cache*
 Whether or not to cache AJAX requests.  Cache is based solely on URL, not URL + data, so if you are making multiple requests to the same URL with different data, turn off cache.

 ex: `{params:{id:1},url:'mypage.php'}` and `{params:{id:2},url:'mypage.php'}` will access the same value in the cache.

 _Default_: false

*closer*
 The HTML to display when a tip is to be manually closed (ie: when triggered by a click).
 
 All HTML in 'closer' will be injected inside another element that has the close listener, so you don't need to specify the #tipped-closer element in this value.

 _Default_: "Close"

*marginX*
 The pixels to the right of the element that the tip should appear.  This amount will be overridden if necessary to ensure the entire tip shows on the screen.
 
 _Possible values_: Any integer.  Negative numbers will position the tip to the left of the right edge of the triggering element.

 _Default_: 10

*marginY*
 The pixels to the bottom of the element that the tip should appear.  This amount will be overridden if necessary to ensure the entire tip shows on the screen.

 _Possible values_: Any integer.  Negative numbers will position the tip above of the bottom edge of the triggering element
 
 _Default_: 10

*mode*

 The method by which the tip shows & hides.  "hover" shows and hides the tip when the trigger is hovered.  "click" shows the tip when the trigger is clicked, and requires clicking of the closer to go away

 _Possible values_: "hover", "click"

 _Default_: "hover"


*params*

 An object representing the parameters to send along with an AJAX request as the "data" parameter.

 _Possible values_:

    » A function: The function must return an object, which will be passed as "data".  This function will be passed a jQuery object representing the triggering element.

    » An object: Will be passed as "data"

 _Default_: An empty object, _{}_

*source*

 The source of the value to display

 _Possible values_:

  » _title_: Value to display will be pulled from the "title" attribute of the triggering element.

  » _url_: Value to display will be returned by an AJAX call.  This value must be the letters "u", "r", "l", not a web address.  The address to make the call to is defined with the "url" option.

  » _A function_: Value to display will be returned from the this function.  The function will be passed a jQuery object representing the triggering element.

  » _Any other string_: Will be treated as the value to display.
